We have created two models: model 1-LSTM.ipynb is LSTM implementation and model 2-Transformer.ipynb is Transformers implementation.

## Instructions

Please download these ‘.ipynb’ notebooks and run on Kaggle as follows:

1.	File -> Import Notebook->Choose model 1-LSTM.ipynb and model 2-Transformer.ipynb
2.	Activate TPU: Accelerator -> TPU v3-8
3.	Install and import all libraries
4.	Click on Run all
